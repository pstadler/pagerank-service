Google PageRank Service
=======================
PageRank Service is a web app providing Google PageRank results. It's powered by [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and using [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) for caching the PageRanks. The reason behind this project are the many broken services because of the frequently changing check-hash algorithm.
